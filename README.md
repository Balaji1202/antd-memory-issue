# Reproduction of a crash when ant-design's Table component is used with sufficiently complicated types

## Steps to reproduce
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pnpm install` (other package managers should work too)
3. Run `pnpm run tsc`

## Notes:
1. See `src/App.tsx` for the code that causes the crash
2. Number of columns is important. More columns => more likely to have a crash
3. Types are generated from GitHub's graphql API with graphql codegen. So, this is somewhat normal situation when you work with types that are autogenerated from some big API
4. Project is generated with Vite
